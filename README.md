## Overview

In traditional automated warehouses, automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and AMRs rely on **centralized dispatch servers** or rigid **stop-and-wait** routing. This model introduces critical vulnerabilities:
1. **Single Point of Failure**: Server disruptions or network drops halt the entire facility.
2. **Deadlocks and Livelocks**: Uncoordinated stop-and-wait robots in narrow aisles frequently deadlock permanently when facing one another.
3. **Wi-Fi Dead Zones**: RF shielding from dense metal storage racks causes packets to drop, causing centralized systems to freeze or risk collisions.
4. **Latency Bottlenecks**: Centralized route negotiation scales poorly with fleet size.

**SIH 26123** implements a **decentralized, edge-computed multi-agent coordination architecture** paired with an **interactive WebGL 3D Digital Twin**. Every AMR acts as an autonomous edge compute node that plans routes locally, negotiates traffic dynamically over a peer-to-peer (P2P) mesh, bids on task manifests, resolves deadlocks cooperatively, and degrades gracefully to onboard LiDAR proximity sensing during total communication blackouts.

---

## Key Features

### 1. Decentralized Multi-Agent Coordination (Edge AI)
* **Local Autonomy**: No central routing brain. Robots maintain their own internal belief state, compute their own A* paths, and adapt dynamically to traffic.
* **P2P Mesh Network**: Robots exchange broadcast and targeted messages (`pos` for positions, `intent` for lookahead paths, `bid` for auction bids, and `blocked` for dynamic hazard gossip).
* **Distributed Task Auctions**: Staged cargo packages are allocated via a decentralized contract net / bid auction protocol where idle units compute bids based on proximity and battery reserves.

### 2. Rigorous Collision & Deadlock Resolution
* **Hybrid Conflict Invariants**:
  * **Vertex Conflicts**: Prevents two robots from occupying the same grid cell.
  * **Swap Conflicts (Edge Conflicts)**: Prevents two robots from traversing the same edge in opposite directions during the same tick (i.e., driving straight through each other).
* **Dynamic Lookahead Intent Negotiation**: Robots broadcast their next 5 planned steps (`LOOKAHEAD_WINDOW`). If trajectories intersect within critical zones, units negotiate priority based on remaining distance-to-goal and deterministic tiebreakers.
* **Polite Yielding**: Idle robots proactively step aside into empty adjacent aisles when an active transport robot approaches.
* **Cycle Deadlock Detection (DFS)**: Automatically detects circular wait conditions ($A \to B \to C \to A$) using depth-first search on a dynamic wait-for graph. Resolves deadlocks deterministically by having the highest-ID robot yield and back out.

### 3. Wi-Fi Dead Zone Resilience (Graceful Degradation)
* **Onboard Sensor Fallback**: Simulates onboard LiDAR bumper sensing ($5\text{ m}$ Manhattan range).
* **Fault Tolerant**: When an AMR enters a simulated radio dead zone (partitioned from P2P traffic), it relies strictly on physical proximity sensing. It safely navigates and avoids collisions without receiving or broadcasting peer packets.

### 4. High-Fidelity 3D Digital Twin (React Three Fiber)
* **Articulated Humanoid AMRs**: Procedural 3D humanoid robots featuring articulated shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, independent pivot joints, and inverse-kinematic walking swing.
* **Physical Cargo Handling Dwell**: Robots physically walk up to loading tables, reach out with grippers, lift labeled cartons, carry them secured in front of their torso, and lower them onto delivery tables with a 10-tick dwell animation.
* **Photorealistic Warehouse Environment**: 20×20 grid floor, instanced high-density pallet racks, loading bays, delivery dispatch tables, floor markings, inductive charging pads, and directional signage.
* **Dynamic Overlays**:
  * **P2P Mesh Rays**: Visual beams representing live peer-to-peer radio transmissions.
  * **Path Trails**: Color-coded planned route projections.
  * **Hazard Zones**: Real-time barricade rendering on blocked aisles.
* **Camera Modes**:
  * `Overview`: Isometric bird's-eye perspective of the full facility.
  * `Top-down`: 2D orthographic warehouse floor plan view.
  * `Follow selected`: Third-person tracking camera locked onto a chosen robot.
  * `Receiving` & `Dispatch`: Dedicated bay vantage points.
  * `Manual orbit`: Free 360° inspection controls.
* **Rack Visibility Modes**: `Full racks` (solid industrial warehouse), `X-ray racks` (semi-transparent for tracking obscured robots), and `Low-rack` (clean aisle view).

### 5. Interactive Disruption Drills
* **Live Aisle Blocking**: Pause the simulation and draw physical barricades directly onto the floor canvas (or click "Auto-block a route"). On resume, the fleet gossips the hazard over the P2P mesh and reroutes on-the-fly using onboard A*.
* **Wi-Fi Dead Zone Injection**: Cut the radio link of any individual unit with a single click to demonstrate real-time offline survival and LiDAR-based obstacle avoidance.

## Benchmarks & Empirical Results

The coordination algorithm was evaluated using the **headless benchmark suite** (`backend/test_simulation.py`) against the standard industry baseline.

### Experimental Setup
* **Episodes**: 100 consecutive deterministic Monte Carlo runs.
* **Fleet**: 3 Autonomous Mobile Robots.
* **Grid**: 20×20 discrete warehouse environment with aisle choke points and cross-warehouse cargo routes.
* **Workload**: Fixed manifest where 6 packages are staged on west loading tables and transported across the floor to east delivery tables. Both algorithms receive identical start coordinates and manifest pairings.
* **Audit**: Exact verification of vertex collisions (same cell) and swap collisions (simultaneous cross-through), with timeout episodes excluded from time averages.

### Benchmark Results

| Metric | Traditional Stop-and-Wait Baseline | Decentralized Edge-AI Fleet | Improvement / Verdict |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Same-Cell Collisions** | 0 | **0** | **100% Zero-Collision Guarantee** |
| **Swap / Edge Collisions** | 0 | **0** | **100% Zero-Collision Guarantee** |
| **Permanent Deadlocks (Naive)** | **96 / 100 (96%)** | **0 / 100 (0%)** | **Deadlocks Completely Eliminated** |
| **Completion Rate** | 4% (Naive) / 100% (with backoff) | **100 / 100 (100%)** | **100% Mission Reliability** |
| **Avg. Ticks (1.0s stall tolerance)** | 100.2 ticks | **81.0 ticks** | **19.2% Faster** |
| **Avg. Ticks (1.5s stall tolerance)** | 109.6 ticks | **81.0 ticks** | **26.1% Faster** |
| **Avg. Ticks (2.0s stall tolerance)** | 118.3 ticks | **81.0 ticks** | **31.5% Faster** |

> [!NOTE]
> Textbook stop-and-wait (plan once, halt when blocked, never replan) deadlocks permanently in 96% of episodes because opposing robots in narrow aisles cannot negotiate. When the baseline is given an industrial backoff escape hatch (re-running A* after $N$ stalled ticks), our decentralized fleet consistently outperforms it by **19.2% to 31.5%** in completion speed while maintaining zero collisions.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

1. **Initial Inspection**:
   * Open `http://localhost:5173`. Confirm the connection badge displays **`Connected · Ready`**.
   * Notice the 6 packages staged on the West loading tables (`LOADING 1` to `LOADING 6`).
2. **Start Simulation**:
   * Set playback speed to `0.5x` or `0.25x` for clear observation.
   * Click **`Start demonstration`**.
3. **Inspect Cargo Transfer Dwell**:
   * Click on robot card **Farhan** in the dashboard and select **`Follow selected`** in Camera Presets.
   * Watch the unit navigate to its assigned loading table. Notice the 10-tick handling dwell: the robot reaches out its grippers, secures carton `#1`, lifts it, and turns towards the destination.
   * The package is carried directly in front of the torso during transport.
4. **Disruption Drill 1: Dynamic Aisle Barricade**:
   * Click **`Pause`**.
   * Click **`Place barriers`** in the Disruption Drills section.
   * Click or drag across an active aisle to create physical obstacles.
   * Click **`Resume`**.
   * Watch the fleet gossip the blocked cells over the P2P mesh (`hazard` event) and reroute seamlessly using onboard A* without collisions.
5. **Disruption Drill 2: Wi-Fi Dead Zone Partition**:
   * Click on **`Farhan ✕`** in the Wi-Fi Dead Zone controls.
   * The robot loses radio connectivity (P2P packets blocked).
   * Notice the AMR continues navigating safely, avoiding peer collisions purely via onboard proximity sensing.
   * Click the button again to reconnect the unit to the mesh.
6. **Delivery & Completion**:
   * Follow the unit to `DELIVERY 6` on the East side.
   * Watch the robot lower and release the carton. Delivery counters update strictly upon physical placement.
