# Charging cycle + rack storage & retrieval

Two features, implemented end to end (backend simulation, WebSocket contract, 3D twin, dashboard)
and verified with the repo's own test suites.

---

## 1. Battery + autonomous charging cycle

### What a judge now sees

A unit carrying a carton drops under the threshold, keeps its promise and finishes the leg it is
physically holding, then broadcasts a claim on the nearest free pad over the P2P mesh, hands its
remaining work back to the auction, drives to the pad, docks, charges visibly to 100%, releases the
pad and rejoins the fleet.

### Backend

**`config.py`**

| Constant | Value | Note |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `BATTERY_LOW_THRESHOLD` | `50.0` | was `20.0` (per request: detour below 50%) |
| `BATTERY_CHARGE_PER_TICK` | `2.0` | new: ~25 ticks from 50% to full, long enough to watch |
| `BATTERY_CHARGED_LEVEL` | `100.0` | new: undock threshold |
| `DEMO_BATTERY_LEVELS` | `[58.0, 100.0, 76.0]` | new: opening SoC so a charge run happens early |
| `MESSAGE_TYPES` | `+ charger_claim`, `+ charger_release` | new mesh message types |

**`robot.py`** — new `target_charger`, `known_charger_claims`, `charge_cycles`,
`charge_started_tick` fields and:

* `_select_charger(exclude=())` — nearest free pad by real A\* path cost, not Euclidean guesswork.
* `_claim_charger()` / `_release_charger()` — broadcast `charger_claim` / `charger_release`.
* `_resolve_charger_conflict()` — **occupancy negotiation**. If two units claim the same pad, the
  winner is the lower `(path_cost, robot_id)` tuple; the loser re-runs `_select_charger` with the
  contested pad excluded. Deterministic, so it cannot ping-pong.
* `_begin_charging()` / charge tick — `+BATTERY_CHARGE_PER_TICK` per tick, emits `charged` when full.
* `calculate_bid()` returns `0.0` while charging, so a docked unit is never auctioned new work.
* A unit that is **carrying** cargo defers the charge run until the carton is placed (logged once,
  not once per tick).

**`main.py`** — new WebSocket action `drain_battery { robot_id, level? }` (defaults to
`BATTERY_LOW_THRESHOLD - 3`, clamped to `1..BATTERY_MAX`) so the charge run can be triggered on cue
instead of waiting ~90 s of driving. `metrics.record_charge_cycle()` on every completed run.

### Frontend

* **`components/Robot.jsx`** — new `BatteryPack`: a pack mounted on the **back** of the torso
  (`z = -0.2`) with four LED bars that light and change colour with state of charge, a coiled cable
  lead and a connector, plus a pulsing glow while charging.
* **`components/Robot.jsx`** — new `ChargeCable`: a world-space `CatmullRomCurve3` tube from the pad
  post to the connector on the robot's back, with a droop in the middle and a travelling energy
  pulse sphere that runs post → robot while charging. Rendered as a sibling of the robot root so it
  stays in world space and does not inherit the walk bob.
* **`components/Warehouse.jsx`** — new `ChargerPad`: breathing ring, charge post, and a rising
  energy bolt while occupied. The pad sign shows the occupant's or claimant's name, so the P2P
  negotiation is visible on the floor.
* Battery badge on the robot label (`⚡NN%`), chest strip turns green while docked.
* **`dashboard/Controls.jsx`** — per-unit **Force low battery** buttons in the Disruption drills
  block (disabled while that unit is already on a charge run).
* **`dashboard/RobotStatus.jsx`** — battery bar colour-coded by level, pulses while charging, shows
  `Charging · CHARGE n` / `Booked CHARGE n` and a `Charge runs` counter.

## 2. Storage & retrieval (putaway / pick from racks)

The nine 2×2 rack islands are no longer scenery. They are addressable inventory.

```
RECEIVE  →  PUTAWAY  →  STORE      inbound table  →  rack slot
PICK     →  PACK     →  DISPATCH   rack slot      →  delivery table
```

### Backend

**`warehouse.py`** — `_extract_rack_slots()` derives **9 islands / 36 slots** from the existing
layout, no hand-maintained coordinate table. Islands are named `A1`…`C3`, slots `A1-01`…`C3-04`.
Each slot carries `{id, code, island, cell, access, state, task_id}` where `access` is the walkable
aisle cell a robot stands in (preference W → E → N → S). New API: `get_slot`, `free_slots`,
`reserve_slot`, `mark_slot_stored`, `release_slot`, `reset_racks`, `stored_slots`.
`to_serializable()` now publishes `racks` and `rack_islands`.

**`task_manager.py`** — a `Task` now has a `stage` (`putaway` | `retrieval` | `direct`), an `origin`
and `destination`, and `pickup_kind` / `dropoff_kind` (`table` | `rack`). `generate_manifest(storage=True)`
spreads slots across islands via `ISLAND_ORDER` so routes fan out over the whole floor instead of
hugging one aisle. `complete_leg()` returns `('stored' | 'delivered', task)`: finishing a putaway leg
does **not** complete the task, it flips the task to a retrieval leg out of that slot. Slots are
reserved on assignment, so two robots can never be sent to the same slot.

**`presentation_robot.py`** — the 10-tick handling dwell now knows where it is reaching: the
`handling` payload carries `place` (`table` | `rack`), `target`, `face`, `stage` and `slot_code`.

**`metrics.py`** — new `packages_stored` and `charge_cycles` counters, so putaway is measured
separately from dispatch and a stored carton is never double-counted as delivered.

### Frontend

* **`components/Warehouse.jsx`** — rack slots are live. The decorative carton in a slot is skipped
  when the slot is claimed, and a real `CargoBox` is drawn in its place; the access aisle cell tints
  green (stored) or amber (reserved). Each island gets an `A1`…`C3` sign so the slot codes in the
  dashboard match the floor.
* **`utils/presentation.js`** — `transferPose()` is rack-aware, with separate reach heights for the
  low and high shelf views and labels like *Reaching into rack*, *Lifting off shelf*,
  *Sliding onto shelf*.
* **`utils/simulationState.js`** — new `storing` / `retrieving` statuses, `RACK <slot>` as a next
  destination, and `stored` / `inRacks` in the mission summary.
* **`dashboard/TaskQueue.jsx`** — stage chips (`putaway` / `retrieval` / `direct`), slot codes on
  every rack leg, and the two-flow legend.
* **`dashboard/Dashboard.jsx`**, **`MetricsPanel.jsx`**, **`EventLog.jsx`**, **`App.jsx`** — an
  *In racks* chip, *Put away in racks* and *Autonomous charge runs* tiles, a `Storage` event label,
  and the viewport caption is now `RECEIVE → PUTAWAY → STORE · PICK → PACK → DISPATCH`.

## Verification (all run, all green)

```
python3 -m py_compile *.py                              COMPILE_OK
python3 -m unittest test_presentation_contract -v        6/6 OK
python3 smoke_demo.py                                    PASS
cd frontend && node --test src/utils/*.test.js          16/16 OK
```

`smoke_demo.py` (new, headless, no server needed) runs a full episode and asserts the things that
are easy to get wrong:

```
islands              : A1 A2 A3 B1 B2 B3 C1 C2 C3   (36 slots)
opening SoC          : Farhan 58.0  Debojyoti 100.0  Gaurav 76.0
ticks                : 209
put away             : 6/6
dispatched           : 6/6
charge cycles        : Farhan 1 (74.2)  Debojyoti 0  Gaurav 1 (79.9)
collisions           : 0
pad double-books     : 0
slots left dirty     : []
```

The 100-episode benchmark (`test_simulation.py`) still reports **81.0 ticks vs 100.2 baseline =
19.2 % faster, 0 collisions, 100/100 completed**, byte-identical to the number already in the
README, and it now also asserts a new invariant: **`double-booked charge pads : 0`**.

> The benchmark's `[FAIL] headline improvement 19.2% is below the 20% target` line is pre-existing
> and unchanged by this work — the headless benchmark constructs plain `robot.Robot` with a full
> battery and no storage manifest, so charging and putaway do not perturb it. It is a measured
> result, not a crash.

## README rows to update

Two small edits keep the docs honest:

1. In **Configuration & Tuning**, `BATTERY_LOW_THRESHOLD` is now `50.0`, and add:

```
| `BATTERY_CHARGE_PER_TICK` | `2.0`   | Battery recovered per tick while docked on a pad |
| `BATTERY_CHARGED_LEVEL`   | `100.0` | Level at which a unit undocks and releases the pad |
| `DEMO_BATTERY_LEVELS`     | `[58.0, 100.0, 76.0]` | Opening SoC per unit for the live demo |
| `STORAGE_FLOW_ENABLED`    | `True`  | Route packages through rack slots instead of table-to-table |
```

2. In **Demonstration Walkthrough**, the flow is now two legs
   (`RECEIVE → PUTAWAY → STORE`, then `PICK → PACK → DISPATCH`), and there is a third drill:
   *Force low battery* → watch the unit claim a pad over the mesh, hand its package back, dock and
   resume.
